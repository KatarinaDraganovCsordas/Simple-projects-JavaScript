# Football Team Cards

This project showcases a simple web application that generates player cards 
for a favorite football team. The team in focus is Argentina, 
particularly the 1986 World Cup-winning squad. 
The application allows users to filter and display player cards based on different criteria.

## Project Overview
The project involves creating a dynamic webpage that displays player cards for the 1986 
Argentina national football team. Users can filter the player cards based on 
different criteria such as position, nickname, and more.

## Player Card Generation
Player cards are dynamically generated using JavaScript. 
The 'setPlayerCards' function takes an array of player objects as input 
and creates HTML elements for each player. The player cards include 
information such as the player's name, position, number, and nickname (if available).

## Filtering Players
Users can filter player cards by selecting different options from the dropdown menu. 
The available filters include:

* All Players: Displays cards for all players in the squad.
* Nickname: Displays cards only for players with nicknames.
* Forward/Midfielder/Defender/Goalkeeper: Displays cards based on player positions.

The webpage updates in real-time as users select different filtering options.

## Team Information
The team's basic information, including the team name, sport, year of the World Cup victory 
and head coach, is displayed at the top of the webpage. 
This information is retrieved from the 'myFavoriteFootballTeam' object.

## Development
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The code is modular, and developers can easily modify player data or extend the functionality. 
The player data is stored in the myFavoriteFootballTeam object, 
allowing for easy updates and customization.

Feel free to contribute, share, or modify the code to suit your preferences or use case. 
Enjoy exploring the player cards of the legendary 1986 Argentina national football team!
