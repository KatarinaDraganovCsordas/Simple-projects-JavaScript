# p5.js
Welcome to the file for the p5.js YouTube course projects! In this repository, you'll find five small projects 
completed as part of a p5.js tutorial series on YouTube (freeCodeCamp channel).

Each project comes with its own detailed README file providing instructions, explanations, and sometimes additional resources. 
Feel free to explore each project individually to learn more about p5.js and how it can be used to create interactive and creative applications.

Feel free to clone or fork this file to explore the projects, experiment with the code, and expand upon them. Happy coding!
