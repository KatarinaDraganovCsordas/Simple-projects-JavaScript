# Beautiful Trigonometry

## Overview:

"Beautiful Trigonometry" is a simple interactive project that visualizes the elegance of trigonometric functions, 
particularly focusing on the relationship between angles, circles, and coordinates. 
The project creates an aesthetically pleasing animation, showcasing the harmonious patterns generated by trigonometric calculations.


## Features:

Dynamic Visualization:

The canvas displays a mesmerizing scene where a point moves along the circumference of a circle based on trigonometric functions.
The angle of the point is controlled to create a continuous, fluid motion.
Axis Representation:

Multiple axes are included, each demonstrating a different phase relationship with the main point.
The axes are evenly distributed around the circle, highlighting the periodic nature of trigonometric functions.
Interactivity:

The user can experiment with the project by adjusting parameters, such as the number of axes or the radius of the circle.


## Technical Details:

The project is implemented using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding.
Trigonometric functions (cos and sin) are employed to calculate the coordinates of points on the circle.
The 'angle' variable controls the rotation of the main point, creating the animated effect.
The 'shiftingAngle' array stores phase shifts for each axis, creating a visually appealing arrangement.

## Contribution:

Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to enhance visual aesthetics, add features, or optimize the code.
