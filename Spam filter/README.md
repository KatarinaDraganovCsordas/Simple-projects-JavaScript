# Spam Filter
This project is a simple JavaScript-based spam filter designed to detect spam messages based on predefined patterns. 
It includes a set of regular expressions that match common spam phrases and keywords. 
When a user inputs a message into the designated input field and clicks the check button, the program evaluates whether the message contains any spam patterns.

## How It Works
The spam filter utilizes regular expressions to identify specific patterns commonly found in spam messages. 
These patterns include phrases such as "please help," mentions of large sums of money, offers of free items, 
references to stock alerts, and salutations like "dear friend." The program checks whether the user-provided message matches any of these patterns.
