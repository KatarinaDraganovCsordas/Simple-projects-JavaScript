# Palindrome Checker
This JavaScript code is designed to check if a given input text is a palindrome or not. 
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads 
the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## Usage
1. Open the palindrome.html file in a web browsern (with palindrome.js and palindrome.css).
2. Enter a text in the input field provided.
3. Click the "Check" button.
4. The result will be displayed below the input field, indicating whether the
   entered text is a palindrome or not.

## How It Works
The JavaScript code in palindrome.js performs the following steps:

* It retrieves the input text from the HTML input element.
* It processes the input text by converting it to lowercase and removing non-alphabetic characters.
* It reverses the processed text.
* It compares the processed text with its reverse to determine if it's a palindrome.
* It displays the result in the HTML below the input field.
* Make sure to input a value before clicking the "Check" button. If no value is entered, an alert will prompt you to input a value.

## Notes
This code was completed from scratch by myself without external assistance.
