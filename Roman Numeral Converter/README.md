# Roman Numeral Converter
This project serves as a Roman Numeral Converter, developed as part of my certification journey on freeCodeCamp. 
The converter translates numeric input into Roman numerals using JavaScript. I completed this project independently, 
showcasing my understanding of algorithmic problem-solving and web development.

## Features
* Roman Numeral Conversion
The core functionality of this project lies in the 'convertToRoman' function. 
It employs a series of conditional statements to convert a given numeric input into its Roman numeral equivalent. 
The conversion is achieved by iteratively subtracting predefined values from the input and appending the corresponding symbols.

* Popup Feature
A notable feature of this project is the popup functionality. By invoking the 'openPopup' and 'closePopup' functions,
the user can trigger the display and concealment of a popup element, respectively.
This interactive element enhances the user experience, providing a dynamic aspect to the application.

## Usage
To utilize the Roman Numeral Converter, input a numeric value into the designated field on the webpage. 
Upon triggering the conversion, the Roman numeral equivalent will be displayed in a user-friendly format.

## Certification 
This project was undertaken as part of the freeCodeCamp certification program, 
highlighting my commitment to continuous learning and skill development. 
It stands as a testament to my ability to independently tackle coding challenges and implement practical solutions.

Feel free to explore and utilize this Roman Numeral Converter for your own learning and development purposes.
