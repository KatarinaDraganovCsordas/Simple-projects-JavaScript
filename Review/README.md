# Review

The Review poject is a simple web application that showcases a collection of reviews from various 
individuals. Users can navigate through the reviews using previous and next buttons 
or they can opt for a random review using the "surprise me" button. Each review includes the 
reviewer's name, job title, an image, and a brief comment.
