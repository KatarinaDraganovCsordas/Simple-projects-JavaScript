# Background Change Effect
## Overview
This project implements an interactive image background change effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
When you move your mouse over the image, it reveals another image underneath, 
creating a transition effect between the two images.

## Setup
1. Download the required files: Ensure you have the following file structure:
2. HTML: Open background.html in your web browser to see the effect in action.
3. CSS: The CSS file background.css should be located in the styles directory and linked correctly in the HTML file.
4. JavaScript: The JavaScript file background.js should be located in the scripts directory and linked correctly in the HTML file.
5. Images: Place your images in the kepek/background_change_img directory, and ensure the image paths in the HTML file are correct.

## Usage
1. Open the background.html file in a web browser.
2. Move your mouse over the image to see the background change effect in action.

## Customization
* Images: Replace transparent.png, original.jpg, and arrow.png with your own images. Update the paths in the HTML file if necessary.
* Styles: Customize the look and feel by editing the background.css file.
* JavaScript: Modify the background.js file to adjust the interactivity and behavior of the effect.
