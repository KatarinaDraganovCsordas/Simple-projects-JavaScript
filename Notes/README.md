# Notes App
This project is a simple Notes App that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The notes 
are saved to the browser's local storage so that they persist even after the page is reloaded.

## Features
* Create Notes: Add new notes by clicking the "Create notes" button.
* Edit Notes: Edit notes directly within the app.
* Delete Notes: Remove notes by clicking the delete icon.
* Persistent Storage: Notes are saved in the browser's local storage and persist across sessions.
