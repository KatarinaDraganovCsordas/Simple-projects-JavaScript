# Decimal to Binary Converter
This project is a simple web application that converts decimal numbers to 
binary using a recursive algorithm. It provides a visual representation 
of the recursive process through a call stack animation.

## How to Use
1. Input a decimal number in the provided text field.
2. Click the "Convert" button or press Enter.
3. The binary equivalent of the input decimal number will be displayed in the result section.
4. Optionally, for the input value of 5, a call stack animation will be shown
   to visualize the recursive process.
