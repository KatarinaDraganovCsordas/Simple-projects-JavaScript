# Simple-projects-JavaScript

Welcome to my Simple-projects-JavaScript repository! This repository contains the projects I've completed as part of the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) certification and a few more small projects.

It also contains some CSS, HTML and  p5.js.
