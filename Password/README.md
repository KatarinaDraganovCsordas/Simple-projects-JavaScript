# Password Strength Indicator
This project is a simple web-based password strength indicator. It provides real-time feedback on 
the strength of a user's password as they type it. The password strength is categorized into 
three levels: weak, medium, and strong.

## Usage
Open the password.html file in your web browser to see the password strength indicator in action. As you type a password into the input field, the script will evaluate its strength and display a message indicating whether the password is weak, medium, or strong.
