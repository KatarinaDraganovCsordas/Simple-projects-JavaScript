# 1. Password Strength Indicator
This project is a simple web-based password strength indicator. It provides real-time feedback on 
the strength of a user's password as they type it. The password strength is categorized into 
three levels: weak, medium, and strong.

## Usage
Open the password.html file in your web browser to see the password strength indicator in action. As you type a password into the input field, the script will evaluate its strength and display a message indicating whether the password is weak, medium, or strong.

## File Structure
* password.html: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the web page.
* password.css: The CSS file that styles the web page.
* password.js: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for evaluating password strength.
* img - kepek/send-icon.png: The image used for the submit button icon.

# 2. Password Toggle Feature
This project demonstrates a simple password input field with a toggle feature to show or hide the password. The toggle functionality is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
* Password Visibility Toggle: Users can toggle the visibility of their password by clicking an eye icon.
* Responsive Design: The input field and functionality are responsive and work well on different screen sizes.
