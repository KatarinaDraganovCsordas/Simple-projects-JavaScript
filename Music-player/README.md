# Music Player App
This is a simple music player app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to play, pause, skip to the next or previous track, 
shuffle the playlist, and delete songs from the playlist. 
The app utilizes the HTML5 <audio> element for playing audio.

* Shuffle: Shuffle the playlist to play songs in a random order.

* Delete: Remove a song from the playlist by clicking the delete button next to it.

* Reset Playlist: If the playlist is empty, a "Reset Playlist" button will appear,
  allowing you to reset the playlist to its default state.

Each song has a title, artist, duration, and a link to the audio file.
