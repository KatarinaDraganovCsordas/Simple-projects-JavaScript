# Music Player App
This is a simple music player app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to play, pause, skip to the next or previous track, 
shuffle the playlist, and delete songs from the playlist. 
The app utilizes the HTML5 <audio> element for playing audio.

## Features
* Play/Pause: Click the play button to start playing the current song,
  or pause it by clicking the pause button.

* Next/Previous: Navigate through the playlist using the next and previous buttons.

* Shuffle: Shuffle the playlist to play songs in a random order.

* Delete: Remove a song from the playlist by clicking the delete button next to it.

* Reset Playlist: If the playlist is empty, a "Reset Playlist" button will appear,
  allowing you to reset the playlist to its default state.


## Playlist
The app comes with a predefined playlist of songs by Quincy Larson. 
Each song has a title, artist, duration, and a link to the audio file.
