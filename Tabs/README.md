# Tabs Web Application
This project is a simple web application that demonstrates the implementation of tab functionality 
using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Tabs are a common user interface pattern used to organize content into separate sections that are 
displayed one at a time. This project provides a basic example of tabs functionality, 
where users can click on different tabs to display corresponding content.
