# Authors Page
This project is a simple web application that fetches author data from a JSON file and displays it dynamically on a webpage. It utilizes JavaScript to fetch data asynchronously and manipulate the DOM to display the author information.

## Features
* Fetches author data from a remote JSON file.
* Dynamically displays author cards on the webpage.
* Supports loading more authors as needed.

## How it Works
1. The project fetches author data from a JSON file hosted on a remote server using the Fetch API.
2. Upon successful retrieval of the data, it dynamically generates HTML markup for each author and displays it on the webpage.
3. Users can click the "Load More" button to fetch and display additional authors in batches of 8.
4. If there are no more authors to load, the button will be disabled.
